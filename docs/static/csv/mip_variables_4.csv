ApoE4;Genetic;adni-merge;Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele: is the strongest risk factor for Late Onset Alzheimer Disease (LOAD). At least one copy of APOE-e4
rs3865444_T;Genetic;adni-merge;The less common allele for this SNP, rs3865444(T), is associated with a slight decrease in risk for Alzheimer's disease, on the order of 0.9x (i.e. a 10% decrease in risk).
rs11136000_T;Genetic;adni-merge;"rs11136000 is a SNP associated with the clusterin CLU gene, which has also been known as the APOJ gene.
A study of over 5,000 Alzheimer's disease patients (and over 10,000 controls) found a slight protective effect of the (T) allele of this SNP. rs11136000(T) carriers had a slightly decreased risk for Alzheimer's disease, with an odds ratio of 0.84 (CI: 0.8-0.9, p=1.4x10e-9). The association of this SNP and late-onset Alzheimer's disease was replicated over a total of another 1829 cases (and 2576 controls)."

MMSE;"–
";adni-merge;Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): is a global assessment of cognitive status (Folstein et al., 1975).The MMSE is a fully structured scale that consists of 30 points grouped into seven categories. A perfect score is 30 points, a score of 24 is the recommended, and most frequently used, cutpoint for dementia, a score of 23 or lower indicates dementia
MOCA;"–
";adni-merge;Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). was designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: a ttention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Time to administer the MoCA is approximately 10 minutes. The total possible score is 30 points, a score of 26 or above is considered normal. This test was not applied in ADNI-I

The ADAS is a brief cognitive test battery that assesses learning and memory, language production, language comprehension, constructional praxis, ideational praxis, and orientation
