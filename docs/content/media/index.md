## MIP in a Nutshell
<iframe width="90%" height="400px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZcWBKMq487c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- New machine learning techniques and algorithms : k-nearest neighbor, Gaussian Process Regression, SVM, Random Forest
- Experiments: user can create Experiments on existing models (own or shared), configure and apply cross-validation partitions, run the Experiments to view results, save the Experiments and optionally share them with the MIP Community</li>
- Integration of Experiments into existing MIP functionality (My Data, My Community, Article writting, Biological Signatures of Diseases) - i.e. visualise experiments and their running status, see related experiments (based on same model), include experiment results when writing articles</li>
- Apps section revamped (style improved + voting) (please note that the Apps section is still in the incipient phase and further work will be engaged to improve it)</li>
- Epidemiological Exploration : user may now select a whole group of variables for configuration and creation of Models</li>


### First public release of the MIP (March 2016)</h3>
The MIP was publicly released on 31st March 2016 along with the other platforms of the Human Brain Project. The video below features all platforms, while the part dedicated to the MIP is to be seen between 1:45:00 and 2:00:00</p>

### The HBP Medical Informatics Platform

The Medical Informatics Platform (MIP), built by Subproject 8 of the Human Brain Project, is a web-based platform allowing users not only to share data and know-how, but also to collaborate in a true translational way.
